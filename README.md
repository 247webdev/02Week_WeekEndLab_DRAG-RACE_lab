# Drag Race!

Let's build a visual model of how acceleration works in different vehicles by
making a drag race demonstration that has an SF GoCar, motorcycle, an
Audi S4 and a semi-truck! 

This won't be a fair race. So, if you want it to be more fair, you may use 
vehicles that are a little more compatible, or look at the super bonus
for a challenge that can make the drag race more fair, by letting you
change the vehicles that are in the race.

## What should it do?

* Show how an SF GoCar, a motorcylce, an Audi S4, and a semi-truck would
perform in a drag race visually

* Use HTML, CSS, some images from google, and JS.

* You should implement JS objects that have the following
  properties and functions, demonstrating your understanding of
constructors and prototypical inheritance, by modeling how the different 
vehicles behave differently, dependent upon their varying characteristics

* The cars should be lined up at a start line

* The cars should demonstrate their different acceleration behavior from
  the start line visually

## Properties
* An engine that produces some power
* Mass
* A drag coefficient

## Functions
* A way to start a car
* A way to apply power
* A way to stop the car

## Bonus

* Have the winner of the drag race be displayed after that car hits the
finish line
* Be able to start the race from the beginning

## Super-bonus

* Display other vehicles to add to the drag race
* Take vehicles out of the race
* Show the velocity of the vehicle as its moving
