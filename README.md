# Drag Race!

Let's build a visual model of how acceleration works in different vehicles by
making a drag race demonstration that has an SF GoCar, motorcycle, an
Audi S4 and a semi-truck! 

This won't be a fair race. So, if you want it to be more fair, you may use 
vehicles that are a little more compatible, or look at the super bonus
for a challenge that can make the drag race more fair, by letting you
change the vehicles that are in the race.

## What should it do?

### Day 1
* Show how an SF GoCar, a motorcylce, an Audi S4, and a semi-truck would
  perform in a drag race visually

* Use HTML, CSS, some images from google, and JS.

* You should implement JS objects that have the following
  properties and functions, demonstrating your understanding of:
    * constructors (*day 1*) 
    * prototypical inheritance (*day 2*) by modeling how the different 
      vehicles behave differently, dependent upon their varying
      characteristics

* Implement view objects in js that represent the html elements on the
  page and allow you to control them separately from the underlying 

* The cars should be lined up at a start line

* The cars should demonstrate their different acceleration behavior from
  the start line visually

## Properties

* An engine that produces some power and may be started and stopped
* Mass
* A drag coefficient

## Functions
* A way to start a car
* A way to apply power
* A way to stop the car

### Note: If you finish all the day 1 stuff early, you may get started
on day 2 functionality and the bonuses/super bonuses, but keep in mind
that there's still a lot you'll want to learn on Thursday before you 
work on that. Pace yourselves.

## Day 2: In addition

* A GoCar may only be driven if its in drive. Same with the Audi
* A motorcycle needs to be upshifted to accelerate
* A semi needs to have its air brakes applied, before it may stop

## Bonus

* Have the winner of the drag race be displayed after that car hits the
finish line
* Be able to start the race from the beginning

## Super-bonus

* Display other vehicles to add to the drag race
* Take vehicles out of the race
* Show the velocity of the vehicle as its moving
