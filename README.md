# Drag Race!

Let's build a model of how acceleration works in different vehicles by
making a drag race demonstration that has an SF GoCar, motorcycle, an
Audi S4 and a semi-truck! This won't be a fair race. So, if you want it
to be more fair, you can use vehicles that are a little more comparable.
