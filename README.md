# Drag Race!

Let's build a visual model of how acceleration works in different vehicles by
making a drag race demonstration that has an SF GoCar, motorcycle, an
Audi S4 and a semi-truck! 

This won't be a fair race. So, if you want it to be more fair, you may use 
vehicles that are a little more compatible.

## What should it do?

* Show how an SF GoCar, a motorcylce, an Audi S4, and a semi-truck would
perform in a drag race visually

* Use HTML, CSS, some images from google, and JS.

* You should implement JS objects that implement the following
  properties and functions, demonstrating your understanding of
prototypical inheritance, by modeling how the different vehicles above
behave differently, dependent upon their varying characteristics

* The cars should be lined up at a start line

* The cars should demonstrate their different acceleration behavior from
  the start line visually

## Properties
* An engine that produces some power
* Mass
* A drag coefficient

## Functions
* A way to start a car
* A way to apply power
* A way to stop the car

## Bonus

Have the winner of the drag race be displayed after that car hits the
finish line

## Super-bonus

* Be able to start the race from the beginning
* Display other vehicles to add to the drag race
